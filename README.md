# Market Insight Navigator
 Market Insight Navigator is designed for a leading technology retailer to transform their decision-making with a Power BI dashboard, offering a daily overview of sales and costs across Portuguese online stores. It features sales data with/without tax, cost variations, profit margins, and a geographical sales breakdown. The solution enables performance comparison by store, sales targets, and historical evaluations, enhancing strategy formulation for market efficiency. Additionally, it incorporates sales predictions, delivery metrics, and customer insights, with multi-currency support for international partners.
 
A major technology retail company aimed to have a solution providing a daily view of product sales and related cost in all their Portuguese online stores. 
This would help the decision-making process and the definition of strategies for a more efficient market operation. 
To this end, business data was provided as baseline for the creation of a visual solution using Power BI. 

1.	a dashboard where we can see a daily view of our Sales Value, with and without tax. 

2.	It is important to understand the variation of Costs and the profit margin. It Would be interesting to have that information calculated and easy to understand. Beside that it’s important to have a geographic view of the sales value.


3.	For my daily job I need to compare the performance of each store. I would like to see the sales by store and be capable of compare the total sales with the target for each store. And would like to see the sales by product compared to it target value.

4.	Since we have historical data, can you show me the evaluation by year, month, week and so on? will be very useful! But, apart sales volume, it is important to us the costs and gross margin volume. And don’t forget our KPIS! We need to highlight them to facilitate data analysis/visualization.


5.	 I can’t find information about product sales target. Should we consider any formula? If possible, we can use the following logic: The monthly sales target of a product will be plus 25% of the total sales for that Product in same period, last year. Well, I don’t know if you can, but we would love if you can give us a sales prediction for the next months. Any other suggestions will be welcome. Fill free to suggest new or other approach and analysis.

6.	For me it’s very interesting to measure how long it takes to delivery an order (Only for orders that were delivered). Also, I need to know how many orders are still in progress (Not Delivery) And It’s very important to know our customers and see their Sales.


7.	I almost forgot! We have some partners in the USA and they want to see the information not only in euros but also in dollars. If you find any problems in our data, please let us know.
